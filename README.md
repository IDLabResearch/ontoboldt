# Ontoboldt

Despite extensive research, 
the practical use of **Ontology Engineering** is still hampered
because information regarding Ontology Engineering activities 
and life cycle models is scattered in literature or is hard-wired in legacy tools.

Therefore, we analyzed existing literature to create the [Ontoboldt Knowledge Graph](https://w3id.org/ontoboldt/ns/ontoboldt) 
containing descriptions of existing Ontology Engineering processes, 
activities and tasks to offer a one-stop shop for Ontology Engineering-related tasks.

Ontoboldt contains descriptions for 9 Ontology Engineering processes, 
83 activities and 58 tasks. 
Furthermore, we linked 40 related publications, 
and 17 related resources to our Knowledge Graph
to indicate provenance and to provide further explanations.

The following sources were used to populate Ontoboldt

* [Project deliverables](http://neon-project.org/nw/Deliverables.html) from the [NeOn project](http://neon-project.org/nw/Welcome_to_the_NeOn_Project.html) contributed 9 processes, 75 activities, and 58 tasks
* The [UPON methodology](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0306437908000628) contributed 5 activities and 15 tasks
* The [SAMOD methodology](http://essepuntato.github.io/samod/) contributed 3 activities and 15 tasks
