This criterion is taken into account in the second place, because our second concern is to consider most of the identified terms of the ORSD.  • High value of precision.

If everything works fine (i.e., all model, data and query test are passed) release a milestone. In case there is another motivating scenario to be addressed, iterate the process, otherwise stop. In the last step, OEs work to refactor the current model, shared among all the test cases in BoT, and, accordingly, each ABox and SQ of each test case, if needed. In doing that task, OEs must strictly follow the following principles: – Reuse existing knowledge. Reusing concepts and relations defined in other models is encouraged and often labelled as a common good practice [1]. The reuse can result either in including external entities in the current model as they are or in providing an alignment (An alignment is set of correspondences between entities belonging to two models different models. ) or an harmonisation (harmonisation is the process of modifying a model (and also to align it, if necessary) to fully fit or include it into another model. ) with another model. – Document it. Adding annotations – i.e., labels (i.e., rdfs:label), comments (i.e., rdfs:comment), and provenance information (i.e., rdfs:isDefinedBy) – on ontological entities, so as to provide natural language descriptions of them, using at least one language (e.g., English). It is an important aspect to take into consideration, since there are several tools available, e.g., LODE [2], that are able to process an ontology in source format and to produce an HTML human-readable documentation of it starting from the annotations it has specified. – Take advantages from technologies. When possible, enriching the current model by using all the capabilities offered by the formal language in which it is developed – e.g., when using OWL 2 DL: keys, property characteristics (transitivity, symmetry, etc.), property chains, inverse properties and the like – in order to infer automatically as much information as possible starting from a (possible) small set of real data. In particular, it is important to avoid over-classifications, for instance by specifying assertions that may be automatically inferred by a reasoner – e.g., in creating an inverse property of a property P it is not needed to define explicitly its domain and range because they will be inferred from P itself. -- [1] Uschold, M., & King, M.
