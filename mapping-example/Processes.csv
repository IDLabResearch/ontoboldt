"Pr1","P1","Non Ontologial Resource Reuse","","refers to taking available non-ontological resources (Non-Ontological Resources (NORs), which were defined in [1], are knowledge-aware resources whose semantics have not been formalized yet by an ontology. ), e.g., databases, controlled vocabularies, etc., for the development of ontologies. Non-Ontological Resource Reuse is defined in [1] as the process of choosing the most suitable non-ontological resources for the development of ontologies. -- [1] D5.4.1.

"Pr3","P3","Ontological Resource Reuse","","is defined as the process of using available ontological resources (ontologies, modules, statements, or ontology design patterns) in the solution of different problems (e.g., the development of different ontology-based applications, the activity of ontology aligning (as background knowledge), etc.).
