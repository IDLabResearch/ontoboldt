The Ontoboldt Knowledge Graph contains descriptions of 
Ontology Engineering processes, activities and tasks (here generally refered to as procedures).
Such procedures are conceptually different, 
e.g. a process always consists of activities, 
whereas an activity can be either stand-alone or consist of tasks.

Therefore the vocabulary presented here introduces
some classes to distinguish different concepts
in the Knowledge Graph.

The vocabulary is available in the `./docs/ns` folder.
