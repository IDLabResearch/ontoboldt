# Ontology Engineering Vocabulary

Although the Ontoboldt Knowledge Graph uses existing vocabularies such as *P-PLAN* or *FRBR*,
some new terms were introduced to distinguish certain concepts.

The Ontoboldt Knowledge Graph contains descriptions of 
Ontology Engineering **processes**, **activities** and **tasks** (here generally referred to as **procedures**),
as well as related resources such as **publications** or **tools**.
Such procedures are conceptually different, 
e.g. a process always consists of activities, 
whereas an activity can be either stand-alone or consist of tasks.

Therefore the lightweight vocabulary presented here introduces
some classes to distinguish different concepts
in the Knowledge Graph.

The vocabulary is available in the `../docs/ns` folder, or via https://w3id.org/ontoboldt

todo: Add vocabulary to the current folder and configure continuous integration to deploy vocabulary to `./docs/ns`
