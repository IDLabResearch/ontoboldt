# Ontoboldt

Despite extensive research, 
the practical use of **Ontology Engineering** is still hampered
because information regarding Ontology Engineering activities 
and life cycle models is scattered in literature or is hard-wired in legacy tools.

Therefore, we analyzed existing literature to create the Ontoboldt Knowledge Graph 
containing descriptions of existing Ontology Engineering processes, 
activities and tasks to offer a one-stop shop for Ontology Engineering-related tasks.


Ontoboldt contains descriptions for 9 Ontology Engineering processes, 
83 activities and 58 tasks. 
**Furthermore, we linked 40 related publications, 
and 9 related resources to our Knowledge Graph**
to indicate provenance and to provide further explanations.

The following sources were used to populate Ontoboldt

* [Project deliverables](http://neon-project.org/nw/Deliverables.html) from the [NeOn project](http://neon-project.org/nw/Welcome_to_the_NeOn_Project.html) contributed 9 processes, 75 activities, and 58 tasks
* The [UPON methodology](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0306437908000628) contributed 5 activities and 15 tasks
* The [SAMOD methodology](http://essepuntato.github.io/samod/) contributed 3 activities and 15 tasks
