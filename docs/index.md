# Ontoboldt

Despite extensive research, 
the practical use of **Ontology Engineering** is still hampered
because information regarding Ontology Engineering activities 
and life cycle models is scattered in literature or is hard-wired in legacy tools.

Therefore, we analyzed existing literature to create the Ontoboldt Knowledge Graph 
containing descriptions of existing Ontology Engineering processes, 
activities and tasks to offer a one-stop shop for Ontology Engineering-related tasks.
